      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a strong background in building modern web applications.
        I specialize in React, Tailwind CSS, and full-stack development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small business websites to large-scale applications.
        I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I love hiking, photography, and exploring different cultures through travel.
        I believe that continuous learning and curiosity are key to growth, both personally and professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create meaningful, user-friendly experiences that make a difference.
